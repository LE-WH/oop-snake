# oop-snake

This is a project from the OOP class COMP130135.04 in Fudan Univ.

Initial version: https://github.com/jhpy1024/sfSnake

I added the following features:

- Cool snake appearance
- Moving in 360 degrees, with your cursor! You can either control it by clicking, or holding the left button of your mouse.
- Multiple fruits to obtain at once, and they offer different bonuses.
- Different sounds for different events.
- Changing background color, opening grid, and changing grid color.
- An option interface to change the settings. 

You can just download the codes and run main.exe to immediately play it.
